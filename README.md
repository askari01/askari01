## Nothing is Impossible to Willing ❤️ - Alternate Universe
This is My most ambitious project. A Shopping App which uses AR (augmented reality) for dynamic rendering on client side with feed form source.
Its not even near completion but I managed to build a proof of concept. If you are interested in it I can share video of it.
